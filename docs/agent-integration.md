# Agent Integration

Connect an external agent to the assistant for three superpowers:

1. **Instant memory recall** — sub-second answers from your agent's long-term memory.
2. **Deep escalation** — questions and tasks the smart home can't handle itself.
3. **Voice report-back** — long-running work that announces its result in the room
   that asked.

**This project is built around [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — the
open-source personal agent platform — and OpenClaw is what these features were
designed and tested against. OpenClaw brings the pieces a voice assistant can't:
months of long-term memory in plain markdown (which the instant-recall path
greps directly), channels (iMessage, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, …) for
delivering details, scheduled jobs that can speak through the announce endpoint,
a browser for real research, and — with the
[openclaw-voice-call-realtime](https://github.com/TristanBrotherton/openclaw-voice-call-realtime)
plugin — a real phone.

**You don't need an agent.** Everything else — conversation, smart-home control,
timers, memory notes, speaker recognition, web search — works standalone. And the
contracts below are **agent-agnostic**: the option is named `openclaw_url` after
the agent this project runs, but anything that answers two simple POST shapes
works.

## OpenClaw in five minutes

**A ready-to-run reference bridge ships in this repo:**
[`examples/openclaw-bridge/`](../examples/openclaw-bridge/) — one dependency-free
Node file plus a setup README (secrets, service files for macOS/Linux, the
TOOLS.md snippet that teaches OpenClaw to announce, smoke tests). What it does:

- `{"question", "room"}` → spawn `openclaw agent --agent main --session-key
  voicepe-<unique> --message "<voice directive> <question>"` and return its
  stdout as `answer`. The directive tells the agent to act immediately, reply in
  one spoken sentence, be thorough on lookups, save found facts to memory, and
  report long work back via the announce endpoint for the asking `room`.
- `{"recall"}` → grep OpenClaw's own memory files (`MEMORY.md`, recent
  `memory/*.md` dailies and person-files) and return matching lines. No agent
  turn — that's the whole trick behind sub-second recall.
- If a turn outlives ~120 s, reply `{"answer": "Still working on that — I'll
  tell you when it's ready."}`, let the turn finish, and POST the eventual
  answer to the room's announce endpoint yourself — report-back becomes a
  guarantee, not a hope.

Teach OpenClaw the announce endpoint once (a short note in its workspace
`TOOLS.md` with the curl command and the per-room ports) and its own scheduled
jobs and long tasks can speak in the house too.

## The bridge contract

Set `openclaw_url` to an HTTP endpoint you control (a small "bridge" in front of
your agent). The add-on POSTs JSON to that one URL; the body shape selects the
operation:

### Escalation — `ask_openclaw`

```
POST <openclaw_url>
Content-Type: application/json

{"question": "Research flight prices to London for October", "room": "kitchen"}
```

```
200 OK
{"answer": "Direct flights in October start around ..."}
```

- `question` — the user's request, with context the model added.
- `room` — the add-on's `instance_name`, lowercased. Your bridge should remember
  it: if the work outlasts the voice turn, deliver the eventual answer to that
  room's [announce endpoint](#the-announce-endpoint).
- The add-on waits up to **145 seconds** for the answer. If your agent needs
  longer, have the bridge reply at ~120 s with a "still working on it — I'll
  report back" style `answer`, keep the task running, and deliver the real result
  via announce when it's done.
- The model is instructed to use this only for things Home Assistant can't do
  itself (memory, messaging, calendar, research, cross-app tasks) — never for
  smart-home control.

When `openclaw_url` is set, the add-on registers `ask_openclaw` natively and
skips any same-named tool from the MCP server, so the model sees exactly one.
This matters: Home Assistant core hard-caps every MCP request at **60 seconds**,
which kills longer agent turns — the direct route is what gives you the
2.5-minute budget. Speaker gating (`male_only_tools`) applies to the direct
route exactly as it does to MCP tools.

### Instant recall — `recall_memory`

```
POST <openclaw_url>
Content-Type: application/json

{"recall": "Grandma phone number"}
```

```
200 OK
{"matches": ["Grandma: +1 555 0123 (landline, prefers calls after 10am)"]}
```

- Return an array of matching lines from your agent's memory/notes files —
  a plain deterministic text search is exactly right. Speed is the point:
  this is the assistant's **first stop** for "what's X's number" / "when is Y's
  birthday" / "what did we decide about Z", and it should answer in well under a
  second.
- Return `{"matches": []}` when nothing matches — the assistant then falls back
  to a full `ask_openclaw` turn.

## The announce endpoint

The reverse direction: your agent (or anything on your LAN) speaks in the room.

Enable it by setting **both** `announce_port` and `announce_token` in the add-on.

```
POST http://<ha-host>:<announce_port>/announce
Authorization: Bearer <announce_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{"message": "Your London flight research is done: direct flights start at ..."}
```

Responses:

| Status | Body | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | `{"status": "announced"}` | Spoken on the device |
| `400` | `{"error": ...}` | Invalid JSON or empty message |
| `401` | `{"error": "unauthorized"}` | Bad/missing bearer token |
| `503` | `{"error": "no device connected"}` | Device offline — **fall back to a text channel** |
| `500` | `{"error": "announcement failed"}` | Playback failed |

Details:

- Messages are capped at **600 characters** — keep report-backs summary-sized.
- Playback uses the device's **guarded TTS lane** (the same path timers use), so
  the assistant can't hear its own announcement and reply to it.
- The add-on runs on the **host network** — the bearer token is the only lock.
  Generate a long random one and treat it as a secret.
- One endpoint per add-on instance (per room). A multi-room setup gives your
  agent one announce URL per room; the `room` field on escalations tells it
  which one to use.

## The full delegation loop

Putting it together — what a long-running task looks like end to end:

```
You (kitchen): "Research flight prices to London for October."
  └─ add-on → bridge: {"question": "...", "room": "kitchen"}      (ask_openclaw)
       └─ agent starts working…
  ┌─ bridge → add-on at ~120 s: {"answer": "Still working on it — I'll report back."}
Assistant: "I'm still looking into it — I'll let you know."
       └─ agent finishes (5 minutes later, or 50)
  ┌─ agent → kitchen announce endpoint: {"message": "Flights to London in October…"}
Device (kitchen): speaks the result out loud.
       └─ (503? The agent texts you the details instead.)
```

Fast tasks never touch the announce path — the answer just comes back inside the
voice turn.

## Checklist

1. Stand up a bridge endpoint that answers the two POST shapes above.
2. Set `openclaw_url` to it in the add-on configuration.
3. Set `announce_port` + `announce_token`; give your agent the URL and token
   (one pair per room/instance).
4. Optionally gate escalation to a specific speaker via `male_only_tools`.
5. Say something only your agent would know — then delegate something slow and
   walk away.
